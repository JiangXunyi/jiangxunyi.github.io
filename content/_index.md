              CLUE-ReDial: Leveraging Large Language Models for Generating Comprehensive Dataset with UrLs and
              Explanation
              * Designed and implemented a multi-agent framework leveraging RAG and LLMs, achieving a 4× efficiency boost in generating interpretable recommendation explanations. Expanded the ReDial dataset to 40k high-quality utterances for fine-tuning conversational LLMs, enhancing domain-specific accuracy in movie recommendations.
              * Designed a multi-agent framework, leveraging an early-stop module in the self-refine process to generate comprehensive and interpretable recommendation explanations, boosting transparency in recommendations.
              * Applied web crawling techniques to create a movie dataset containing 25k entries, using Python, PyTorch, LaTeX, and the Singapore National High-Performance Computing (HPC) platform.
