Hi! 👋🏻 I am Xunyi Jiang, a master student of Computer Science and Engineering at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu). I graduated from [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn), being recognized as one of the top ten graduates from the School of Science at SUSTech and Oustanding Thesis.

> *Physicists seek order in chaos through equations, while statisticians find meaning where equations fail.*

My research journey began with using statistical models to explain the development of the scientific community—science for science—under the guidance of Professor [Yifang Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v6f9Fy8AAAAJ&hl=en), related with [hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12739) and [mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06794).

Inspired by how models can reveal hidden patterns in science, I now harness AI to drive transformative change. I host the [self-supervised seminar](https://niusj03.github.io/23summer/), which is supported by [Chao Wang](https://wangcmath.github.io) and joined the [NUS-WING](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/) group as research assistant from Jan to May 2024, advised by [Min-Yen Kan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aNVcd3EAAAAJ&hl=en). Currently, I am working with [Prof. Julian Mcauley](http://julianmcauley.com) on catastrophic forgetting in LLMs.

I love music! This is one of my passion apart from coding and math. I play both cello and piano, and I used to be a principle cellist of the SUSTech Harmonic Symphonic Orchestra. I also produce music and [drawing](https://jiangxunyi.github.io/post/MyDrawingGallary/javascript/) in my free time.
